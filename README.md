### stonefish_ros package for ROS

This package delivers a ROS interface for the _Stonefish_ library. It also includes a standard simulator node, which loads the simulation scenario from a scenario description file (XML). The included parser extends the standard functionality of the _Stonefish_ library to enable ROS style search for files, resolution of arguments as well as a complete message interface. 

### Installation

1. Install the open-source [Stonefish](https://github.com/patrykcieslak/stonefish) library (>=0.9).
2. Install the open-source ROS package [cola2_msgs](https://bitbucket.org/iquarobotics/cola2_msgs).
3. Clone the *stonefish_ros* package to your catkin workspace.
4. Compile the workspace.

### Launching

To run the standard simulator node you have to include the 'simulator.launch' file in your own launch file, overriding the default arguments.
This package does not include any examples of usage. The best way to learn how to use this package is to install the [stonefish_cirs](https://github.com/patrykcieslak/stonefish_cirs) package, containing multiple fully working examples of robots.
